MLP vs Deep+ MLP: Herein a simple and common compration between multilayer perceptron and deep neural network presented on 4 benchmark dataset which contains: 1-MNist 2-Fashion MNist 3-Cfar10 4-Cfar100.
result are tableau below.

| Benchmark Name | MLP| Deep Neural Networks |
| :---         |     :---:      |          :---: |
| Mnist  | 0.9706     | 0.9455    |
|Fashion Mnist     | 0.8609       | 0.7810    |
|Cfar 10     | 0.1005       | 0.4053      |
