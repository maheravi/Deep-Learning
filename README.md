### MLP vs Deep:

Herein a simple and common compration between multilayer perceptron and deep neural network presented on 4 benchmark dataset which contains: MNist, Fashion MNist, Cfar10, and Cfar100.

Results of model accuracy are tableau below.

| Benchmark Name | MLP| Deep Neural Networks |
| :---         |     :---:      |          :---: |
| MNist  | 0.9706     | 0.9967    |
|Fashion MNist     | 0.8609       | 0.9525    |
|Cfar10     | 0.1005       | 0.8134      |
|Cfar100     | 0.0086       | 0.4522      |
