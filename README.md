MLP vs Deep+ MLP: Herein a simple and common compration between multilayer perceptron and deep neural network presented on 4 benchmark dataset which contains: MNist, Fashion MNist, Cfar10, and Cfar100.

result are tableau below.

| Benchmark Name | MLP| Deep Neural Networks |
| :---         |     :---:      |          :---: |
| Mnist  | 0.9706     | 0.9455    |
|Fashion Mnist     | 0.8609       | 0.7810    |
|Cfar 10     | 0.1005       | 0.4053      |
|Cfar 100     | 0.0086       | 0.0211      |
